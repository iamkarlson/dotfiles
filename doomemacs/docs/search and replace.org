* Emacs cheatsheet - Search and Replace
** Replace in multiple files
1. Query Replace (Interactive with confirmation):
- M-% (or SPC s r if using evil-mode) - Query replace in current buffer
- C-M-% - Query replace using regex

2. Project-wide search and replace:
- SPC s p - Search in project (uses your configured search tool)
- SPC / - Search in project root
- After searching, press C-c C-e to enter "edit mode" in the search results buffer
- Make your changes and press C-c C-c to apply them with confirmation

3. Using Vertico + Consult (from your init.el):
- SPC s s - Search symbol at point
- SPC s S - Search symbol at point in project

4. Using your configured tools:
Since you have vertico, magit, and treemacs configured, the most efficient workflow for project-wide search and replace with confirmation would be:

1. SPC / or SPC s p to search your project
2. When results appear, press C-c C-e to make the buffer editable
3. Use M-% to do query-replace within the results buffer
4. Press y for each replacement you want to confirm, n to skip, ! to replace all remaining

This gives you full control over each replacement while working across your entire project.

** Repeat search and search history

For regular search (/ or C-s):
- C-s then press ↑ (up arrow) or M-p to go through previous searches
- ↓ (down arrow) or M-n to go forward in search history

For query replace (M-%):
- When prompted for the search string, press M-p to cycle through previous search terms
- When prompted for replacement string, press M-p for previous replacements

For project search (SPC /):
- After invoking the command, press M-p to access previous search terms

Evil mode specific (if using vim keybindings):
- In normal mode, press / then ↑ to access search history
- Or use n and N to repeat the last search forward/backward

The search history persists across sessions, so your recent searches will be available even
after restarting Emacs.
